To solve the equation ax⁴+bx³+cx²+dx+f=0 for x using python, we can use the sympy library, which provides functions for solving equations and performing other symbolic mathematics tasks.  Here is an example of how we could use sympy to solve the equation:
import sympy

# define the variables and coefficients
a, b, c, d, f, x = sympy.symbols('a b c d f x')

# define the equation
eq = a*x**4 + b*x**3 + c*x**2 + d*x + f

# solve the equation
solution = sympy.solve(eq, x)

# print the solution
print(solution)
